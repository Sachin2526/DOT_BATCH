                Today, surfing is one of the most popular and most preferred extreme sports in the world. It is done by riding the waves in the sea or the ocean by standing or lying on a surfboard. This extreme sport, thought to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere in ancient times, was a necessity rather than entertainment or a hobby. Used as a way to return to the shore from the ships originally, surfing became a hobby with time and an official sport in 1920.
